# Pokitmeter Desktop App

This is a fork of [jdonj/BLE-pokitMeter-Windows-App](https://github.com/jdonj/BLE-pokitMeter-Windows-App).

Initially I created the fork to try and get it to play nicely with Linux, but there doesn't seem to be any issues so far! The only changes (as of 29/01/2022) are an amended directory structure, `poetry` for dependency management, and graceful termination when executed from the terminal.

Please see the original README for full details - [README.origin.md](README.origin.md). The commit at which this fork occurred is tagged `origin` - [current diff](https://github.com/jdonj/BLE-pokitMeter-Windows-App/compare/master...FergusInLondon:master).
